# sign-up-form
This is the Sign-up Form project from The Odin Project.

A fairly interesting project with involvement of HTML form elements. Large amount of CSS.

Some JavaScript codes are involved too, primarily to achieve the from client-side validation function.

Also added a reveal password button for fun, probably should've improved it to be an icon, inside the input box too.
